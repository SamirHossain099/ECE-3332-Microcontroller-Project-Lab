Artificial Intelligence vs Neural Networks vs Machine Learning:

    Artificial Intelligence (AI):
    Formal definition: The effort to automate intellectual tasks normally performed by humans
    - Can be simple or complex 
        Ex: A bunch of rules put together to tell a chess bot what to do
        Ex: Path finding algorithm
        - These are still simulating some intellectual human behavior

    Machine Learning (ML):
    - A part of AI
    - Machine learning figures out the rules for us when given some data.
    - Rather than giving the program rules, an algorithm finds the rules for us. 
        - We don't necessarily know what rules it comes up with
    - Will have an input layer, and 1 or 2 rules layer, and then output layer

    Neural Networks:
    - A form of machine learning that uses a layered reppresentation of data.
    - Will have an input layer, multiple rules layers, and then an output layer.
    - The "Deep Learning" neural networks have multiple layers.
    - Layer representation of data.
    - NOT modeled aftered the brain. 

Data:

    Features vs Lables:
    Features:
    - Features are the input information that we will always have to we give to the model to get some output

    Labels:
    - Lables are the output information what we are trying to predict

Types of Machine Learning:

    Supervised Learning:
    - We have some features and they correspond to some labels.
    - We pass the information to some machine learning model, it finds the rules for us and in the future we can just 
    pass features and get labels.
    - Its called supervised learning because when we pass the features, it makes an arbitrary prediction at first.
    Then it compares it's answer to the lable and tweaks its rules for the next pass of the features.
    - The most common type of learning
    - Advantageous when we have lots of training data

    Unsupervised Learning:
    - When we only have features and have no labels
    - Want the model to find the output for you
    - Ex: Clustering data points: There is a graph of two axises with clusters of data points. The model finds the clusters.

    Reinforcement Learning:
    - No data, there is an agent, environment, and reward.
    - The agent moves in an environment and wants to move toward a target output with the highest reward.
    - The agent tried to maximize the rewards as it explores the environment.
