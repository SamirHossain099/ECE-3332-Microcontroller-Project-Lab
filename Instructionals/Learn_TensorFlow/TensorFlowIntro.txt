Two main components: 
Graphs:
    a variable gets added to the graph and the graph lets say is the summation 
    of two other variables. It does execute the computation, it just states that
    this is the computation to be done for a particular variable.

    Its basically stating the equation but not evaluating it. They are partial computations.
    
    It is called a graph because different computations can be related to one another. 

Sessions:
    A session is a way of executing part or the entire graph.
    Start at the portion of the graph where only constants are tied to the graph
    and then work through the dependances.

Tensors:
    A tensor is a generalization of vectors and matrices to potentially higher dimensions.
    Each tensor represents a partially defined computation that will eventually produce a value. 
    TensorFlow programs work by building a graph of tensor objects that detail how tensors are related. 
    Each tensor has a data type and a shape.
    Data types include: float32, int32, string, and others
    Shape: represents the dimension of data
